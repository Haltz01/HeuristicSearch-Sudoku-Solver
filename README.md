# Sudoku Solver - Heuristic Search (code, results and benchmark)

This project was developed at the University of São Paulo (USP) - Campus São Carlos and it has the objective of solving Sodoku boards by using concepts of IA related to heuristic search. Some benchmark will be done, comparing the results obtained from different strategies, ranging from full "blind search" to hill climbing with some clever heuristics and usage of parallel processing with OpenMP (maybe).
